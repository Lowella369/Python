[ ] Create a program where a user can check if an item is on the menu
•	store the user response in a variable menu_ask
•	use the menu from above and add some additional items
•	the program should be able to ignore case mismatch so that "hello" is found in "Hello World!"

Answer:
menu = "salad, pasta, sandwich, pizza, drinks, dessert, taco, humba"
menu_ask = input("What's your order?: ")
print("Is ", menu_ask, "is on the menu? ", menu_ask.lower() in menu.lower())
